When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when on another computer, or another person is contributing. Or easier to make changes directly on website (quick changes).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

risk of not having finished a project or task and losing data or confusing things. Might forget to pull tasks when necessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are clones of directories on github (from one github directory to another). Clones are identical repositories but either between one's computer and github or on one's computer alone. Branches can exist on both one's computer and gitub (as they will be mirrored.)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can take the info with you, eg on a plane without internet, to work on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

use dropbox or onedrive, although incremental changes to code may not be saved as completely, however, those appear to be much simpler file sharing services than Github!
